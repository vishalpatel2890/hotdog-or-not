# Hot Dog Or Not Hot Dog

### What is it? 
This is an image classifer that can be used to identify whether an image is a hot dog or not. I have also included code and instructions for builiding an API endpoint for the classifier that can be hosted on the cloud. 

### Inspiration 
This started as a group project while I was a student at the Flatiron School Data Science Bootcamp. My partner, [Jaime Cheng](http://github.com/softserveslayer) and I got our inspiration from the HBO series Silicon Valley(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACmydtFDTGs). After a few days of learning the ins and out of neural networks, we were able to successfully train a convolutional neurel network to recognize whether an image was a hot dog or not. After graduation, I was interested in turning this project into a full fledge application that would take an image and return a prediction. My first step was to build and host a REST API for model and am currently working on a frontend for the application.
