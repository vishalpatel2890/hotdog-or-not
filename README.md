# Hot Dog Or Not Hot Dog

### What is it? 
This is an image classifer that can be used to identify whether an image is a hot dog or not. I have also included code and instructions
for builiding an API endpoint for the classifier that can be hosted on the cloud. 

### Inspiration 
This started as a group project while I was a student at the Flatiron School Data Science Bootcamp.
